I am a third year Ph.D. student at the University of Missouri. I completed my masters in commutative algebra under the advising of Rankeya Datta. I am interested in Commutative Algebra and its intersections with Homological Algebra and Algebraic Geometry. When I am not doing math, I am often baking bread and climbing rocks.
